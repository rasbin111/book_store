This project will be my way to learn graphql using real world project. I don't have plan of hosting it in future. And I am sure I won't make it private. 


## Tech used 

For backend, we are using:
- Django
- GraphQL (for API)
- JWT token authentication (django-graphql-jwt)
- sqlite3 for database (will change to postgresql)


For frontend, we will use:
- Reactjs
